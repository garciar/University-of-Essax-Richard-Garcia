									<p>Unit 1</p>
									<p>As a professional computing employee within a company, the ethical issues limit my 
                                       capabilities in providing full support to both the clients and customers. The monitoring 
                                       means that I don’t get to engage a client or customer to a personal level when trying to understand 
                                       their cause of frustrations with the new technologies from the company. This makes the solutions to 
                                       their problems superficial.</p>

                                    <p>Unit 3</p>
                                    <p>In this unit I researched three types of methods. One:Exploratory research, intends merely to explore the 
                                       research questions and does not intend to offer final and conclusive solutions to existing problems.
                                       Two:Conclusive research, this design provides a way to verify and quantify the insights gained from 
                                       exploratory research. The last type is:Qualitative research involves looking in-depth at non-numerical data. 
                                       It is a research method used extensively by researchers studying opinions, themes and motivations as well as artifacts.
                                    <p> Unit 4</p>
                                    <p>In this unit I learnd that research methods are different from research methodologies because they are the ways in which 
                                       you will collect the data for your research project. Things like closed-ended questionnaires/survey and Structured interviews.
                                       The method that I found to be most helpful to me is the interview process. I learned the following during the process:
                                       Keep the questions brief and simple.
                                       Eliminate any potential bias from your questions.
                                       If your topic is very sensitive, you may want to ask indirect questions rather than direct ones.
                                       If you are using a closed-ended question, try to offer every possible answer that a participant could give to that question.
                                       Do not ask questions that assume something of the participant.
                                       Try and keep the questionnaire as short as possible.</p>

                                    <p> Unit 5</p>
                                    <p>In this unit I studied an example of a inappropriate use of a survey.
                                       A detailed report can be found below.</P>
