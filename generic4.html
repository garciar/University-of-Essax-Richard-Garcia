                                    <p>Also in this unit I started my first team project. We had to design a quick two page presentation on the 
                                        security of medical devices.</li>
                                    <p> </p>
                                    <p>Unit 2</p>
                                    <p>In this Unit I discussed and had a chance to Explain common vulnerabilities that can be exploited using toolkits.</p>
                                    <p>We continued our coverage of medical devices from a security point of view.</p> 
                                    <p> </p>
                                    <p>Unit 3</p>
                                    <p> Unit 3 I had a chance to study the fundamental concepts of networks and available of tools useed in network troubleshooting.</p>
                                    <p> We also had a chance to reflect on our pass learning in unit 1 thru 3.</p>

                                    <p>Unit 4
                                    <p> This unit provided me the opportunity to learn a variety of new skills. I learnd how to use Kali Linux and its pen-testing tools as well as the
                                        theory behind network security. I also had the chance to test my skills with kali on a website.</p>
                                    <a href="penetration testing%20(1).docx">Proposed attack document.</a><p>
                                     <p> Unit 5</p>
                                    <p>  In this module I reviewd what make up a network.
                                         I learned about components such as switches, routers, firewalls and gateways and the role such 
                                         equipment plays in different computing environments
                                         I learned that the two most important components of a network are thee switch and router.
                                         Switches allow devices on your network to communicate with each other, as well as with other networks, creating a network of shared resources.
                                         Routers connect multiple networks together. They also connect computers on those networks to the Internet. Routers enable all networked computers to 
                                         share a single Internet connection.</p>
                                    <p> </p>
                                    <p> Unit 6</p>
                                    <p> In this unit we covered and learned more about scanning and security tools. I had the opportunity to learn about the plethora of tools 
                                        at the disposal for a security engineer.</p>

                                    <p> Unit 7</p>
                                    <p> I learned that the challenges and realities in applying effective software risk management processes are difficult, 
                                        in particular integrating the risk management processes into software development organizations. I discovered that there is a 
                                        great benefit to implementing risk management tools and techniques in software development projects. My perceptions are that 
                                        software risk management practices are implementing effective risk management process that will change the organizational culture.</p>
                                    <p> I also learned the use of Kali Linux a security oriented distro of Linux.</p>

                                    <p> Unit 8</p>
                                    <p> This Unit was interesting to me. As I have not ever considered computer security from the legal, social and ethical 
                                        issues faced by todays security professionals.
                                        I have learnd five Key Takeaways from studying the GDPR. One: is organizations must educate key stakeholders throughout the business 
                                        that touch personal data about GDPR and their obligation to obtain consent. Two: the onus is also on companies to understand the security postures of their vendors 
                                        and suppliers as they relate to GDPR and data protection. Three: use this opportunity to help you strengthen partnerships across your organization, including your legal, 
                                        human resources and marketing departments. GDPR isn’t just an IT issue. Four: an organizational perspective, developing tribal knowledge about your unique GDPR compliance 
                                        universe will help ensure a culture that adheres to strong data protection controls. Five: GDPR has helped to advance privacy and security around the world and steered companies 
                                        toward a more holistic approach to data protection, which, in the end, will result in a safer, more secure environment for us to work and live in.</p>
                                    <p> </p>
                                    <p> Unit 9</p>
                                    <p> This week I learnd the importance of log managment. Log management software is necessary in order to collect data, store it in a proper format for as long as needed, and help 
                                        analyze issues and errors. Log management solutions allow system admins to generate their own rules and templates for generating alerts and look for patterns correlating with similar events.
                                        Extensive search options enable system admins to quickly sort, find, and compare past log activity with current activity. This is the first line of defence for the computer system.
                                        The biggest problem with logs is: nobody looks at them. From a security point of view, the purpose of a log is to act as a red flag when something bad is happening. Reviewing logs regularly could help identify malicious 
                                        attacks on your system. Given the large of amount of log data generated by systems, it is impractical to review all of these logs manually each day. Log monitoring software takes care of that task by using rules to automate the review of 
                                        these logs and only point out events that might represent problems or threats.  Often this is done using real-time reporting systems that alert you via email or text when something suspicious is detected.
                                        On reflection the advantage of log management is to quickly nip attacks in the bud. One should setup a security strategy and make sure these steps are taken care of.</p>
                                        1. Decide how and when to generate logs</p>
                                        2. Secure your stored logs to make sure they aren’t maliciously altered by cybercriminals or accidentally altered by well-intentioned employees.</p>
                                        3. Assign an employee you trust to review logs daily.</p>
                                        4. Set up a team of people ready to review suspicious alerts. <p>
                                    <p> </p>
                                    <p> Unit 10</p>
                                    <p> In this unit I learned that in a security breach where one has an unauthorized person gets access to data, devices or networks investigation and troubleshooting 
                                        the problem has to be done. A security breach often occurs when one bypasses security mechanisms. The first step is therefore the investigation phase where the damage is surveyed, 
                                        the attacker identified and then the vulnerability is discovered. After the investigation is done troubleshooting the problem to identify possible solutions then starts. Additional 
                                        damage has to be limited first to prevent unaffected areas from being affected, incoming traffic has then to be filtered, the system is then isolated for further protection measures. 
                                        After successful troubleshooting, it’s important to keep a record of the findings for future reference as learning points.</p>

                                    <p> </p>
									<p> Unit 11</p>
                                    <p> In Unit 11 NNDC, I identified and analyzed security risks and vulnerabilities in IT Networks. Some of the risks facing these systems are malware infection, computer viruses and worms, 
                                        phishing attacks, and distribution of denial of service attacks. When networks are exposed to these risks, there is a possibility of big data loss. To prevent the organizations from undergoing 
                                        losses, appropriate methodologies and tools must be put in place to manage the issues. Regular full scans are essential to make sure the software is free from attacks. All systems need to be 
                                        installed with anti-malware solutions to prevent malware and viruses infections. It is also necessary to be cautious when opening email links to reduce phishing attacks.
                                        To manage and audit risk and security issues, computer systems have to be designed to produce solutions to these issues. As part of the design, a security policy has to come first. Firewalls 
                                        need to be introduced to the system, antiviruses installed and strong passwords put into use. Any new hires have to be screened first before being introduced to the system. In addition, anomalous 
                                        activities need to be investigated on time.
                                        During the unit study, information from multiple sources was gathered to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues. From the resources compiled, to systematically analyze a 
                                        security breach, the first step involves identifying the root cause of the issue. Once the cause is determined, measures to reduce the harm are quickly put in place to prevent further losses. 
                                        After solving the issue, a record is kept to act as a future reference in case the security breach reoccurs. Lastly, the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues that information security 
                                        professionals were discussed in the unit. Information security professionals most of the time have access to personal and confidential information pertaining to individuals and companies' networks 
                                        and systems. It gives them the power to do anything with the information they have access to. IT associations and organizations had to come up and address the legal, ethical, social, and professional 
                                        side of the job. The guidelines are essential because, during training, the specialists only focus on the technical parts of the job and forget that the skills can be misused.
