									<p>A review of the three most common reasons for project failure</p>

                                    <p>Unit 2</p>
                                    <p>I learned that Gherkin is a Domain Specific Language for writing acceptance criteria. Product Manager writes Gherkin acceptance criteria before the team starts work on a feature. 
                                       Having acceptance criteria outlined in an easy to read, easy to understand structure makes it a lot easier for developers and designers to understand the intended user flow.</p>

                                    <p>Task 1: Select one of the news reports that you see here, which involves a technology product.
                                       Develop a list of customer requirements for this product. These should include at least two functional and two non-functional requirements (see last week’s lecturecast).
                                       Present your requirements using the Volere template entries which are listed at (Volere, n.d.).</p>

                                    <p>Task 2:
                                       Select at least two different data structures to hold the data associated with the list of functional and non-functional requirements that you defined for Task 1.
                                       Justify your data structure choices.
                                       Select at least one academic paper, which might be similar to the work of Abeykoon et al. (2020).
                                       Use your sourced information to support your data structure choices.</P>

                                    <p> Unit 5</p>
                                    <p>In this unit I learned how to create a project plan. I learned that there are 6 steps to project planning and management.</p>
                                       
                                       Step 1. You Should start with an executive summary.</p>
                                       The executive summary goes at the beginning of your project plan and should summarize the key points of the project plan. It should restate the purpose of the project plan, highlight the major points of the plan, and describe any results, conclusions, or recommendations from the project.</p>
                                       
                                       Step 2. Find What’s the scope of the project.</p>
                                       There are few things worse than starting on a project only for it to balloon. By defining a project’s scope, you set the boundaries for a project’s start and end dates as well as expectations about deliverables and who approves requests—and what merits approval— throughout a project.</p>
                                       
                                       Step 3. structure your project.</p>
                                       There are several frameworks you could use to guide your project and this will affect your workflow’s organizations and how deliverables are produced and assigned.</p>

                                       Step 4. Find what resources do you have available.</p>
                                       Define the resources you have available for this project: Team, time, budget, technology and physical resources.</p>

                                       Step 5. Timeline.</p>
                                       Adding a project schedule section to your project plan. This part of your plan should set expectations on when you’ll deliver and how you’ll stick to your project timeline or calendar.</p>

                                       Step 6. Learn to manage change.</p>
                                       If you don’t solidify a change management plan, your team will be clueless on what to do when unplanned change hits. A dynamic change management plan will outline the steps to follow and the person to turn to when unforeseen changes occur.</p>

                                    <p> In this unit I have completed Activity 1 and Activity 2.</p>
                                    <p> In activity 2, I was asked to read the articles by Verner et al (2014) and Anton and Nucu (2020) and then answer the following questions: <p/>

                                    <p> 1. What are te main risks that the authors identify? How do these fit into the traditional SDLC model? </p>
                                    <p> 2. Which of the frameworks discussed in the Unit 7 lecturecast would you use to capture and categorise the risks?</p> 
                                    <p> 3. Add a risk and a suggested mitigation to the module forum. </p>
                                    <p> 4. Choose an entry made by one of your colleagues in the wiki and comment on how you might mitigate it. </p>
                                    <a href="Unit 8 Activity 2 (1).docx">Activity 2</a><p>
                                    <p> In activity 1, I create a python program that implements one of the estimation methods covered in the lecturecast this week.</p>
                                    <p> I also create an estimate of the total effort and time to complete the planned demonstration of the python program of the estimation tool.</p>

                                    <p> In this unit I referenced Mertz (2019) resource. I took and old python program of mine and applied at least 3 of the strategies presented in the article to improve its quality.</p>
