									<p> Unit 1</p>
									<p>At the beginning of the unit, I was new to approaches to software development. My understanding of software development, in general, was very shallow. 
                                       The unit focused on the waterfall and agile approaches to software development. The agile approach simplifies the project's complexity, making it easier to 
                                       understand and develop, and it also increases the efficiency of the team developing the software. Scalability is also easy with the agile approach. The waterfall approach 
                                       is important in that the project's end goal can be determined early, and a clear structure of development is used. This unit has also equipped me with knowledge of Unified Modeling Language, 
                                       which simplifies the system providing its blueprints. It is essential in software development because it helps to visualize the system and acts as a guide in constructing the system. 
                                       From the examples and case scenarios learned during the unit study, I am in a position to design and draw UML diagrams for any complex project. Given any activity, I can decompose it into 
                                       a set of tasks and represent it using a flowchart derived from a UML portfolio of modeling techniques. Developing secure software is the goal of every software development industry. 
                                       In the unit, the standards to be used in the software development industry to ensure secure software are developed were discussed. Some of the measures are CERT, CVE, and IEC 62443. 
                                       In addition to creating secure software, there is a need to make an effort to create risk awareness in an organization. Risk awareness involves educating the staff and software users of 
                                       any potential risks that might face a system. By pointing out any potential risks, it is easier to mitigate them. During the study, I tackled several assignments to test my understanding of the 
                                       general course. All the skills gained in class will be helpful to me if I decide to venture into software development. I would therefore recommend the unit be a necessity to all those wishing to
                                       be software developers.</p>

                                    <p> Unit 2</p>
                                    <p> I have gained a lot of knowledge from unit 2. Before starting the unit, I had very little knowledge of the integration of software security in the 
                                        development process. During the study of the unit, we focused on the stages of agile SDLC. These stages include conception where the projects are prioritized, 
                                        inception, which involves identifying team members, construction where team members develop the software, releasing the final project, production of the software, 
                                        and retirement, which involves notifying the customer. At each of the mentioned stages, ensuring the software's security is essential as it prevents security breaches later. 
                                        As a requirement completing the unit, I researched academic literature in software development that follows the agile process giving security a priority. From the research, 
                                        it is clear that the software has to be broken down into small iterations for one to implement the agile approach, and each is of the same duration.
                                        The third outcome from the unit was the creation of UML flowcharts. I learned that it is necessary to analyze software before actually starting its implementation visually. 
                                        The steps of the agile process listed above can be broken down further and represented in a flowchart to help understand the project before developing it. Lastly, emphasis was made 
                                        on a range of ways in which software security can be a problem. Some of the issues listed were lack of information security knowledge, lack of security awareness, and the pressure of 
                                        short iteration, making it hard to do necessary tests. I read on ISO/IEC standards which are very important in ensuring security. These are software standards internationally agreed upon 
                                        by experts who describe the best way of software development. Currently, I am well familiar with the languages and concepts involved in these standards. There is a long list of these languages 
                                        to mention two: ISO-639-1 and ISO 639-2.</p>
                                    <p> Unit 3</p>
                                    <p> This session we learned the concepts of programming languages. We learned that by looking at the basics of programming languages, 
                                        especially the works of Alan Turing and Alonzo Church and different types of programming languages available today. We studied and 
                                        review the development of programming languages.</p> 
                                    <a href="summery post_SS%20(1).docx">An Indepth Summary of Module 1 thru 3 can be found here</a><p>
                                    <p> Unit 4</p>
                                    <p> In this module I explored two programming language, I analyzed the pros and cons of both approaches to investigate 
                                        the most suitable approache for the given security requirements and risks. 
                                        This help me understand how applying such concepts can affect the overall system and its security when designing software.</p>
                                    <p> Unit 5</p>
                                    <p> In this unit I gain an understanding of the theory of testing. I learnd how to develop test plans to guide the testing 
                                          stage of the software development lifecycle. As well as an understanding of the fundamental principles and processes of 
                                          software testing</p>
                                    <p> Unit 6</p>
                                    <p> This Unit we looked at how to apply linters to support Python code development. We completed the team project, I was most enriched by
                                        the 3 hour discussions that the team had as we reviewed the finale paper before submitting it for grading.
                                        Reading the paper by Firdaus et al 2014 was intresting. My thought on this paper can be downloaded in the link below.</P>

                                    <p> I learned to identify and manage security risks in software development project. I was able to better understand the design and development 
                                        of computer programs thru design brief and critically evaluate solutions proposed.
                                        I created a shell program and preformed a critical analysis of 3 main questions.</p>
                                    
                                    <p> 1. What are the two main security vulnerabilities with your shell?</P>
                                        2. What is one recommendation you would make to increase the security of the shell?</P>
                                        3. Add a (pseudo)code example of changes you would make to the shell to improve its security.</p>

                                    <p> Unit 8</p>
                                    <p> In this unit I learnd that cryptography is a particularly interesting field because of the amount of work that is, by necessity, done in secret. 
                                        The irony is that secrecy is not the key to cryptographic algorithm. Regardless of the mathematical theory behind an algorithm, the best algorithms 
                                        are those that are well-known and well-documented because they are also well-tested and 
                                        well-studied! In fact, time is the only true test of good cryptography; any cryptographic scheme that stays in use year 
                                        after year, The strength of cryptography lies in the choice of the keys.
                                        The corollary to this is that organizations should run, not walk, away from any product that uses a proprietary cryptography scheme, ostensibly because the 
                                        algorithm's secrecy is an advantage. The observation that a cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about 
                                        the system — except the key — is known by your adversary has been a fundamental tenet of cryptography for well over 125 years. </p>

                                    <p> This week I learnd about Microservices and how it differs from the monolithic architecture. I learned that the key difference between the two is that every feature 
                                        initially was covered under a single instance that shares a single database. However, with the implementation of microservices, every feature is allotted
                                        to different microservices. Every service is individually built and separately implemented. As depicted in the diagram, the monolithic architecture does not 
                                        segment into a small unit. For efficient flexibility and scaling, the software projects are segmented into loosely combined modules. Therefore, the communication 
                                        becomes seamless and ultimately there will be a boost in productivity. This lead me to better understand the modern programming environment.<p/>

									<p> Unit 10</p>
                                    <p> In this unit, I have learned the evolution of system architectures. To be specific, I have a better understanding of how systems evolved from being distributed to microservices. 
                                        This unit has broadened my mind about the technology of systems. As of now, I am in a better position to describe a variety of distributed systems. Some of these systems include networks, 
                                        distributed database systems, and distributed real-time systems. Each of the stated systems evolved from monolithic to microservices. Choosing whether to use distributed systems has its strength and weaknesses. 
                                        From the teachings in this unit, the resilience of distributed systems are that data can be shared easily between nodes, it is easy to add nodes to the system, and if one node fails, it does not lead to the failure of another node. 
                                        The weaknesses of distributed systems are that loss of data during transmission is easier, providing adequate security systems is challenging also overloading often occurs in the network.
                                        Systems are always prone to attacks, and distributed systems are not an exception. Distributed systems are vulnerable to security attacks such as fraud vulnerabilities where one gains access to a 
                                        system unlawfully. This can occur when confidential information is disclosed to unauthorized personnel. Vulnerability is the corruption of data when an unauthorized user may alter information from 
                                        the system for his purposes. These systems are also prone to denial of service attacks, leading to the system failing to carry out its function. This threat is catastrophic and can lead to significant losses; 
                                        hence it should be significantly considered. The unit focused on attacks on virtual systems. Ways in which the systems need to be protected from the attacks include: advancing malware protection which can be done 
                                        by deploying threat protection on any virtual machine. Access control where administrators are required to apply proper control management on a virtual machine hosting servers, disaster recovery which involves integrating 
                                        virtual machines such that data should be highly available and creating backup strategies for the data. Updating images of virtual systems regularly to ensure the security of data is also important.
                                        Generally, I feel this unit has improved my knowledge of computer systems. By digging deeper into the distributed systems, I can know when to and when not to recommend it to non-experts.</p>

									<p> Unit 11</p>
									<p> Throughout the designing and implementation of the ISS project, I had a chance to learn many technologies involving python and 
                                        flask framework. The designing part was the easiest one since we used the Adobe Xd tool to design a high-fidelity prototype of the application. 
                                        So once we had a good idea of what to implement conceptually, it was time to use python-flask technology coupled with SQL database to implement a full-stack 
                                        application driven by data from sensors. Since this project was a group project, we again used the conceptual ideas from the prototype to guide every member to 
                                        look and feel what to develop even as we subdivided the implementation into sub-tasks for every member to implement before combining them into a single routine. 
                                        The most valuable thing I learned during this process is the ability to structure a python flask application to work with a blueprint to manage other small application 
                                        modules in the project. Working with the flask framework generally has been fun and intriguing for most parts. The process of dividing and combining the tasks seems ideal to achieve more,
                                        but this led to a lot of errors during the process as some members did not implement the standards we had set very well; hence we had to standardize their codes to fit and work with other 
                                        modules of the system. This, as a result, led to time wastage which consequentially meant that we could not put a pin to some tasks required in the final system. </P>
