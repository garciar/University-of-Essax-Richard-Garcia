The bitcoin blockchain is essentially a data structure with an ordered back-linked 
list of blocks containing bitcoin transactions. At the moment, the average number of
transactions per block is around 2000. Check it out here.
Each block within the blockchain is identified by a SHA256 cryptographic
hash algorithm on the block header. The block references its parent using its block 
hash (SHA256 on the parentâ€™s block header also). This results in a sequence of hashes linking 
each block to its parent that creates a chain all the way back to the first block ever created!
